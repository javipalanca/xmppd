1. Preface
=============

Hello, and thank-you for downloading this release of XMPPD, release 0.3-RC1.
This project has stems from Alexey Nezhdanov's work in 2004 and has been
recently taken-up at BlueBridge Technologies Group for further development.

There has been some discussions on the Jabber development list on how we can
get Jabber/XMPP into the hands of everyone using a simple, yet powerful daemon.
We're accomplishing this in a number of ways, one is using Python, and the
second is localization, third is 'Help Desk', and fourth will be an easy to use
web interface.

We have molded Alexey's wonderful code into something that will very soon not
only be modular, as he intended, but also clusterable and multiplexed. We've
even built-in libevent support for super-fast transactions. Made severable
improvements to maintain portability on not only Linux, but Windows, Mac OS X,
Solaris, and even net-BSD.

The key to this is keeping things simple, and powerful -- Something we feel
quite good at.

We hope that this wonderful project that Alexey started will continue forward,
and we cannot wait to show you the passion for communications we have at
BlueBridge!

* Now utilizes libevent for even faster transactions
* Localization Engine
* Utilizes updated xmpppy libraries.
* Countless little tweaks.
* Experimental socket multiplexing with BlueBridge Sockerâ„¢
  (Included in the Socker directory)

3. Installation
==================

Installation is pretty straight-forward. You'll need the following
packages/modules:

* TLS lite
  <http://trevp.net/tlslite/>

* libevent and pyevent (HIGHLY recommended)
  <http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/> and
  <http://www.monkey.org/~dugsong/pyevent/>

* PsyCo (HIGHLY recommended) <http://psyco.sourceforge.net/>

Follow their installation instructions, and then open-up xmppd.cfg in your
favorite text editor. This release's config file looks something like this:

[server]
servernames: 69.107.93.203,127.0.0.1
ssl-cert: xmppd.pem
status_file: xmppd.status
[69.107.93.203]
admins: kris_tate,pixelcort
[127.0.0.1]
admins: kris_tate,pixelcort

Sections are noted by brackets, the first section must be [server].
key:value pairs follow:

servernames -- Comma-deliminated values for your server names
ssl-cert -- Location of your cert's pem file from the xmppd root dir.
status_file -- A file that Help Desk might read to tell users about updates
               to the system or other system status points.

After those are set, you're welcome to make sections for your servers,
respectively. Currently, the only key:value pair is as follows:

admins -- Comma-deliminated values for users who are administrators.

That's it! Simple, Huh? The next revision will be exploring a web interface
that will help with this.

4. Usage
===========

SYNOPSIS:
usage: xmppd.py [options] [-l lang_code] [--hostname HOST] [-s host[:ip]]

options:
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p, --psyco           Enable PsyCo
  --nofallback          Disables fallback support (Upon a major error, the
                        server will not try to restart itself.)
  -l lang_code, --lang=lang_code
                        Used to explicitly set the daemon's default language.
  -d, --debug           Enables debug messaging to console
  --hostname=HOST       Used to explicitly set the hostname or IP of this

  -s host[:ip], --socker=host[:ip]
                        Enables, and connects to the host:ip of a socker(tm)
                        socket multiplexor. [EXPERIMENTAL]
  -i                    Enables Interactive mode, allowing a console user to
